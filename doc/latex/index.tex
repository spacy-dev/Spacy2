Fun\+G is structured as follows.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item In the module \hyperlink{group__CMathGroup}{Common Mathematical Functions} you find functions that are contained in {\ttfamily $<$cmath$>$} together with their derivatives. All header files contained in \hyperlink{group__CMathGroup}{Common Mathematical Functions} can be included either with 
\begin{DoxyPre}{\ttfamily #include "math.hh"} or {\ttfamily #include "fung.hh"} (the latter including all(!) header files of the library).\end{DoxyPre}

\item In the namespace \hyperlink{group__LinearAlgebraGroup}{Linear Algebra} you find operations on matrices. In particular efficient implementations of the elementary building blocks of physical models, the matrix invariants, are provided. This includes (isotropic) principal as well as (anisotropic) mixed invariants, (isochoric) modified principal and mixed invariants and deviatoric invariants (\hyperlink{group__InvariantGroup}{Invariants}). All header files contained in \hyperlink{group__LinearAlgebraGroup}{Linear Algebra} can be included either with 
\begin{DoxyPre}{\ttfamily #include "linear\_algebra.hh"} or {\ttfamily #include "fung.hh"}.\end{DoxyPre}

\item Several models are already implemented in \hyperlink{group__Examples}{Examples}. In particular this includes variations of classical models from \hyperlink{group__Rubber}{Rubber} elasticity, i.\+e. the neo-\/\+Hookean and the Mooney-\/\+Rivlin model. In \hyperlink{group__Biomechanics}{Biomechanics} more complex models for the description of skin tissue and anisotropic descriptions of adipose and muscle tissue are provided.
\item Implementations of product, sum and chain rules are provided in the namespace \hyperlink{group__MathematicalOperationsGroup}{Mathematical Operations}. You do not need to directly use these classes, but rather generate them via operator overloading (see \hyperlink{generate_8hh}{generate.\+hh}).
